# 🛒 Product Scraper - React + Python

This is a full-stack application that scrapes product data from an e-commerce site and displays it in a **React UI**.  
We have used **Python (FastAPI + BeautifulSoup)** for backend scraping & API, and **React + Tailwind CSS** for frontend.  
This project is part of my assignment submission.
